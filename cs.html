		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>In my time as a computer science student at Truman State University, I've been priveleged to have had the opportunity to take a wide range
		of computer science courses covering topics from information technology and computer networks to artificial intelligence to software engineering
		and web development.</p>
		<p>I've also had the opportunity to work on many projects, both on my own and with my peers, throughout my computer science education. I credit 
		working on these projects with aiding me in learning not only how to quickly and efficiently write code and find solutions to problems, but also
		how to effectively communicate or collaborate with others in a work environment. Some of the more sophisticated of these projects are listed below.
		</p>

		class by a few of my classmates and I. The website can be accessed by navigating to <a href="https://nerderynetworking.com" target="_blank"
